Obligatory game features:
 - (done) Saving a go-to simplistic working version to use if we fail to implement GUI
 - (done) Put comments to source code
 - (done) "Refactor" code if possible
 - (done) Create .exe file

Optional game features:
 (done) - Creating different lists of words - different categories; user chooses a category on game start
 (done) - Add selection of categories at game start
 (done) - Keep guesses on screen - use an array and print it
 (done) - Tell user if a letter was already tried
 (done) - Keep Hangman always on the console screen;
 (done) - Replace PRESS ENTER TO CONTINUE command;
 (done) - Clearing the console;
 (done) - set console title (console dimensions cannot be controlled using Java);
 (done) - console size set
 (fixed) - BUG - game closes when user presses Enter without entering a letter.
 (almost fixed) - check if selected category is empty, print message to tell the user to choose another.
 (fixed) - BUG - press any key to exit exits only on Enter. Text changed to "Press Enter to exit".

 

Presentation materials:
 (done) - Add each member's contribution in a text file
 (done) - Each member should commit to the repository
 (done) - Make a simple pptx (perhaps add contributions there)
 (done) - Add statistics to presentation - lines of code written, amount of time spent coding and debugging (3-4 hours of coding, 12+ hours of debugging)
 (done) - Source code!!!

During presentation:
 (done) - One member plays the game while another presents his part
 (done) - Maybe choose 2 people to present - 10 minutes, 6 members (not enough time for all of us to present)
